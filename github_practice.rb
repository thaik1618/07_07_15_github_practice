# 07_07_15_github_practice

# This is meant to give you a bit of practice with GitHub. You will practice cloning, forking, making changes, and pushing your changes on GitHub.
# Start by running the file. (You run a ruby file by typing "ruby github_practice.rb" in your command line.)

# Once you understand how the program works, please change the variable #favsong to one of your favorite songs. Feel 
# free to change your feelings as well. Finally, save your changes.

#Please change the following variable to one of your favorite songs
favsong = "Semi Automatic by Twenty One Pilots"

#Feel free to change your feelings as well.
feeling = "tired"

puts "Whenever I'm writing code, I always love to listen to #{favsong}."
puts "I don't know why... I guess it just makes me feel #{feeling}."
